Tabulated Monte Carlo for proteins, using CHARMM 19 force field and either vacuum or distance-dependent dielectric (epsilon = k*r). 

(This code is more advanced than the one used for Spiriti and Zuckerman, JCTC 10, 5161 (2014)).  At the moment the table functionality and the "peratomconv" and "perfrag" GB modes (see documentation) are not to be used.

# tablemc-proteins-3-26-14c/ and tablemc-proteins-4-24-16/

Source files, header files and compilation script for the codes used for Spiriti and Zuckerman, JCTC 10, 5161 (2014).

# tablemc-proteins-8-23-14/

Contains some minor bug fixes (including a fix to the improper dihedral term)  that do not impact the published results.  This code should be used as a basis for developing further efforts in tabulated Monte Carlo.

# table-generation/

Scripts needed for table generation, including reference geometry files for fragments.

# check/

A set of scripts for testing amino acids.
