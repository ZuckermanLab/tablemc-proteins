\section{General}

Double precision arithmetic is used in the program throughout, except for storing table entries (where single precision saves memory) or when writing DCD files (where it is part of the file format).

Cartesian coordinates are stored as a one-dimensional array in the order $x_1, y_1, z_1, x_2, y_2, z_2, \dots$.  Rotations are represented by normalized quaternions with positive real part, and are stored with the real part first, followed by the $x$, $y$, and $z$ components.  

Most of the basic math routines are found in \verb+rotations.cpp+.  These include converting back and forth between quaternions, matrices, Euler angles, and axis-angle representations, performing quaternion and matrix arithmetic, and performing RMSD fitting, among many other things.  Note that if we have two rotations 1 and 2, the quaternion representing performing rotation 1 followed by 2 is given by the forward product $\mathbf{q}_1 \mathbf{q}_2$, but if using rotation matrices the corresponding matrix is given by the reverse product  $R_2 R_1$ (that is to say, quaternions are multiplied in the same order as the rotations are performed, while matrices are multiplied in the reverse order).  

The system is divided into fragments, each of which is one of several fragment types.  Each fragment type is identified by a name and a numerical index which points to a \verb+fragmenttype+ object in the \verb+top->fragtypes+ array.  The \verb+tables+ array is a two dimensional array of pointers to table objects, which is indexed by pairs of type numbers.  

Throughout most of the code, individual atoms are identified by their index in the overall system, from 0 to \verb+top->natom-1+.  However, each atom also has an index corresponding to its position within the fragment.  In some cases it is necessary to rearrange coordinates of atoms from the ordering they have in the whole system to the ordering they have in an individual fragment.  

The \verb+io.cpp+ file contains subroutines for performing I/O operations.  Many of the constructors for objects also take file names and read information from those files.  

\section{class \texttt{simulation}}
This class represents a simulation, and is defined in \verb+mc.h+.  Besides information on the current configuration, there are many members giving simulation parameters, and open file handles to the trajectory output files.
